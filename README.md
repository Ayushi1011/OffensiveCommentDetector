# OffensiveCommentDetector
# Assumptions made:
  Comments are contained in a text file with each comment on a new line.
  The comments file is opened and the comments are read into a list. 
  The list consists of comments which are tokenized before they are checked with a list of words containting racial slurs. 
  If a match is found, the counter is incremented and the degree of profanity is calculated for that comment.
